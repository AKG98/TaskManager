# Task Management Application
I've built a full-stack task management application **"Task Master"** using the MERN stack with TypeScript. It helps users manage their daily tasks with features like real-time updates, user authentication, and a modern responsive interface.

**Live Demo:** [Task Master](https://taskmanager-36q2.onrender.com/)

## Features Implemented

### Authentication System
I implemented:
- JWT-based secure authentication
- Password encryption with bcrypt
- Protected routes using custom middleware
- Clean login and registration flow

### Task Management Features
Users can:
- Create and manage their tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/pending
- Search through their tasks
- Filter tasks based on completion state
- See updates in real-time

### Technical Implementation
I used:
- TypeScript across the entire stack
- Tailwind CSS for a responsive design
- Redux for state management
- MongoDB for data storage with proper relationships

I built the frontend using:
- React + TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Redux for managing application state
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI for styling
- React Icons for icons

### Backend
For the server, I used:
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- JWT for secure tokens
